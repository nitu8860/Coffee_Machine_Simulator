# Coffee_Machine_Simulator

The Coffee Machine Simulator is a Java program that emulates the functionality of a coffee machine. It allows users to interact with the machine, select and purchase different types of coffee, refill ingredients, collect money, and view machine status and sales analytics. This program serves as a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Features
1. **Show Menu:** Displays the available coffee types and their prices.
2. **Buy Coffee:** Allows users to select a coffee type and dispenses the chosen coffee if the machine has enough ingredients.
3. **Fill Machine:** Enables users to refill the machine with water, milk, and coffee beans.
4. **Take Money:** Allows users to collect the accumulated money from the machine.
5. **Show Machine Status:** Displays the current status of the coffee machine, including the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, and money.
6. **Show Sales Analytics:** Presents sales statistics for each coffee type, including the number of cups sold, total earnings, and the total amount of ingredients consumed.
7. **Exit:** Terminates the program.

## OOPs Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Encapsulation:** The CoffeeMachine class encapsulates the data and behavior related to the coffee machine, such as the machine's water, milk, beans, and money levels, as well as the methods for buying coffee, filling the machine, taking money, and showing analytics.
2. **Abstraction:** The CoffeeMachine class provides a high-level interface for interacting with the coffee machine, abstracting away the internal implementation details.
3. **Inheritance:** The CoffeeMachine class serves as the base class for creating a coffee machine instance with its properties and methods. It can be extended or modified to create specialized coffee machines if desired.
4. **Polymorphism:** The program utilizes polymorphism by utilizing the Map data structure to store the sales and prices of different coffee types. This allows the program to handle different coffee types using a single set of methods, making it easily extensible to accommodate new coffee types.
5. **Modularity:** The program is modular, with each method and functionality encapsulated in separate methods within the CoffeeMachine class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
